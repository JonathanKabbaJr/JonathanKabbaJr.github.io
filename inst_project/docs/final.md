# Title:
Market4Farmers: Connecting Farmers To Customers In Need

# Team Members:
Dennis Poludnev, Eric Le, Idis Giron, Jonathan Kabba, Matt Mortazie.

# Information Problem:
Our group is focused on solving the problems of finding fresh, quality produce when restricted by payment method, government assistance programs, or personal preferences. We realize that despite a large amount of agricultural presence in the Prince Georgeâ€™s County area there are only a few scant options for purchasing from these farms aside from direct orders made at the farm facility. Effectively, we want to bolster and support the "Eat Right When Money's Tight" marketing language that Prince George's County is currently using for their Food Supplement Program.

# Identified Stakeholders/Target Browsers:
The stakeholders involved in this problem are vendors, farmers, the general public, low-income individuals and families, federal and state government agencies, grocery store owners, and general consumers. Potential future stakeholders including small-batch food item producers willing to participate in the Prince Georges County Farmers Market, the Maryland state government, and other organizations focused on assisting those in our community that need it.

# Data you chose to work with:
The API that we have chosen to work with is Farmers Market Dataset from the Prince George County Open Data API website. 
[PGC Open Data API](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Community/Farmers-Market/sphi-rwax) 

# Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem:
Identifying the data problem we wish to solve initially was easy: Considering the rapid growth of problems surrounding the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic we decided to focus on community assistance, and within that realm we found that the available datasets with companion APIs within Prince George's County were plentiful. We ultimately decided that the most important resource was the food supplement program and found it offered a number of fringe benefits to PG County community members outside of the direct participants as well.
The solution we ultimately chose was a web portal that would enable a direct lookup of Farmer's Market locations within PG County. By building a front end with HTML, CSS, and FlexBox. Powering that front end with a back end utilizing JSON, JQuery, JavaScript, Google Maps, and of course PG County Data. 

# Technical system decision rationale:
We decided on a website portal that pulled from PG County's database so that our solution's location on the internet can remain a static resource, while their public database can update. We decided that a simple and lightweight search portal was the best way to respect the abilities of older web-capable devices and varying levels of digital dexterity. 

# How/if your final system helps to address the problem:
We concluded that our system did address the problem and could be expanded to be much more inclusive of other information, additional functionality, and a high degree of polish however that would not add any value to our solution. Particularly considered our primary target user is likely to be further from the latest and greatest technology.

# Challenges faced and impact on final design:
Our initial challenge was simple, but large: How to best present the data. We originally had decided on returning a simple text list to keep our website as lightweight as possible. We decided that a simple Google Maps generated result map would be best as it allows for both a text based and graphical return list. 

# Possible future work diections with this problem:
We envision that this solution could be expanded to cover the entire state of Maryland, and perhaps even be expanded across all 50 states in the USA.
